# Micro Frontend Architecture Implementation

This document explains how the Weather Widget has been transformed into a micro frontend architecture.

## What is a Micro Frontend?

Micro frontends are an architectural pattern where a frontend application is decomposed into smaller, semi-independent "micro applications" that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, while still appearing to users as a single cohesive product.

## Our Implementation

We've implemented a micro frontend architecture using the following approach:

### 1. Module Federation

We're using Webpack Module Federation (via the Vite plugin) to enable runtime loading of micro frontends. This allows:

- Loading code from separate builds
- Sharing dependencies between applications
- Runtime integration of independently deployed applications

### 2. Project Structure

Our architecture consists of two main projects:

- **Weather Widget**: A standalone micro frontend that provides weather functionality
- **Weather Container**: A shell application that integrates the Weather Widget

### 3. Communication Patterns

The micro frontends communicate through:

- **Props**: Passing data down to the micro frontend
- **Events**: Listening to events emitted by the micro frontend
- **Exposed Methods**: Directly calling methods exposed by the micro frontend

### 4. Shared Dependencies

To avoid loading duplicate libraries and ensure consistency, we share common dependencies:

```javascript
shared: ['vue', 'vuetify']
```

### 5. Independent Deployment

Each micro frontend can be built and deployed independently:

- Weather Widget can be deployed to its own hosting
- Container application can be deployed separately
- Updates to one don't require rebuilding the other

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different micro frontends without stepping on each other's toes
2. **Technology Flexibility**: Different micro frontends could use different frameworks if needed
3. **Incremental Upgrades**: Parts of the application can be upgraded independently
4. **Scalable Development**: Multiple teams can work in parallel
5. **Isolated Testing**: Each micro frontend can be tested in isolation

## Running the Applications

To run both applications together:

```bash
./run-micro-frontends.sh
```

This will start both the Weather Widget micro frontend and the Container application.

## Next Steps

To further enhance this micro frontend architecture:

1. Set up independent CI/CD pipelines for each micro frontend
2. Implement versioning for the micro frontends
3. Add more micro frontends to the container application
4. Implement shared authentication and state management
5. Create a design system for consistent styling across micro frontends
