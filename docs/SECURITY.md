# Security Considerations for Micro Frontend Architecture

This document outlines security best practices and considerations for the Weather Widget micro frontend and Container application.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

### Recommendations:

1. **Restrict allowed origins**: Only allow specific domains to load your micro frontends
   ```
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://your-container-domain.com
   ```

2. **Use HTTPS**: Always serve micro frontends over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks

3. **Limit exposed headers**: Only expose necessary headers in CORS configurations

## API Key Security

### Recommendations:

1. **Backend proxy**: Instead of including API keys in frontend code, use a backend proxy:
   ```
   Client → Your Backend → External API (with API key)
   ```

2. **Environment variables**: Store API keys as environment variables and access them at build time
   ```
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Scope and permissions**: Use API keys with the minimum necessary permissions

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

### Recommendations:

1. **Implement CSP headers**: Restrict which resources can be loaded
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com;
   ```

2. **Nonce-based CSP**: For dynamic script loading, use nonces
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-random123'
   ```

3. **Report-only mode**: Test CSP rules before enforcement
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'self';
   ```

## Dependency Security

### Recommendations:

1. **Regular dependency updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. **Vulnerability scanning**: Use tools like Snyk or npm audit
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: Ensure loaded scripts haven't been tampered with
   ```html
   <script src="https://example.com/script.js" 
           integrity="sha384-hash" 
           crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   ```

## Authentication and Authorization

### Recommendations:

1. **Token-based authentication**: Use JWT or similar tokens for authentication between micro frontends

2. **Secure token storage**: Store authentication tokens securely
   ```javascript
   // Prefer httpOnly cookies over localStorage
   document.cookie = "authToken=token123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict";
   ```

3. **Token validation**: Validate tokens on both the client and server side

## Iframe Security (Alternative Approach)

If using iframes as an alternative micro frontend approach:

1. **Sandbox attribute**: Restrict iframe capabilities
   ```html
   <iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
   ```

2. **X-Frame-Options**: Prevent clickjacking attacks
   ```
   X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://trusted-domain.com
   ```

## Communication Security

### Recommendations:

1. **Input validation**: Validate all data passed between micro frontends

2. **Avoid eval()**: Never use eval() or similar functions with data from other micro frontends

3. **Secure event handling**: Be cautious with custom events
   ```javascript
   // Validate event origin
   window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
     if (event.origin !== 'https://trusted-domain.com') return;
     // Process event
   });
   ```

## Deployment Security

### Recommendations:

1. **CI/CD security**: Implement security scanning in your CI/CD pipeline

2. **Access control**: Restrict who can deploy to production

3. **Immutable artifacts**: Use immutable build artifacts for consistent deployments

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Recommendations:

1. **Security logging**: Implement logging for security-relevant events

2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities

3. **Incident response plan**: Have a plan for security incidents

## Regular Security Reviews

### Recommendations:

1. **Code reviews**: Include security considerations in code reviews

2. **Penetration testing**: Regularly test your applications for vulnerabilities

3. **Security training**: Keep the team updated on security best practices
